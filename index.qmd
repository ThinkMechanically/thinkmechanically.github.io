## Welcome to Thinking Mechanically
This website is a place to find as much information as I can on HVAC, with a focus on filter and duct sizing, as well as upcoming information on plumbing, gas, and anything else related to the mechanical trades.

### This site is still under construction
There is still a lot of work to do but use the navigation bar to the left to see anything that is completed or otherwise currently available.

Thank you to the community, developers, and staff at Posit and of Quarto for helping me to make building this website possible.  Also, a particular thanks to the team involved with Observable JS for that framework which made the inputs and javascript simpler to create - without which these calculators and diagrams may have never been completed
