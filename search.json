That provides a little more detail on the key points, below, if int\nI post this information on the site simply so my background can be understood. Because, as you will see, my experience spans a wide area of HVAC and Plumbing, and I have been involved in so may different areas over my career, I have a very good foundation on lots of aspects, but not a lot of specific knowledge in some things. A good example would be, one of the guys I learned HVAC from is capable of telling you how to diagnose specific systems from specific model years for residential systems. That is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is providing insights and resources on how to procure the best information in a short period of time to solve a wide range of problems. There are very things I know immediately (that aren’t core ideas) but I can find specific information on things very quickly. Or tell you the best way of doing estimating, or VRF, or what to look out for, etc. Most of the time, if I am troubleshooting it, I get the necessary manuals in my hand in just a couple minutes and start from there. And that is the kind of resourcefulness I want to spread through the industry.\nWith that rambling complete (I am not known for brevity, I am working on that) here is my experience in the trades.\n\nJob Coordination & Estimation\nPDF creation and overlay, submittal documents, O&M manual creation, design coordination with other trades, engineers, architects, and building owners. Development of coordination drawings. Assistance and consulting for commercial facilities owners on self-performing tenant and core building improvement projects. Created my own estimating tools using Bluebeam. Have created exactly to scale tools in Bluebeam on multiple projects to measure and cut piping for prefabrication before installation with very good accuracy.\n\n\nPlumbing\nSanitary waste and vent, storm piping, gas, chemical drainage, multi horsepower storm and sewage pump controls and installation, gas piping systems, domestic and non potable water systems. Drain cleaning with K50, K60, sewer jetter machine, hot water jetter machine, sewer cameras, and locators. Creation and submittal of original residential and commercial design documents for plan review. Coordination with design engineers on changes for county plan review comment resolutions. Water filtration systems, well and well piping systems.\n\n\nFuel Gas Systems\nNatural Gas and LP, Design, value engineering, custom regulator selection, main regulator repairs, verification of existing system meter and regulator capacities, overcoming design challenges in areas with very low gas pressures (Bethesda, DC), troubleshooting intermittent gas appliance failures, LP systems selection and design, creation and submittal of original residential and commercial design documents for plan review\n\n\nMechanical and HVAC\nVAV systems, rooftop units, design of controls systems for boilers, interlock kitchen equipment, design basic electrical systems, creation and submittal of original residential and commercial design documents for plan review, design grease waste systems, installation, design, and commissioning of VRV/VRF systems, unitary split systems, design, installation and commissioning of mini-split systems, grease duct installation, layout and coordination of mechanical systems, full mechanical projects, cooling tower piping design and installation, VFD installation for HVAC systems, zoning systems, clothes dryer venting, commercial refrigeration controls and piping, fire dampers, steam and hydronic piping, smoke damper commissioning, fire damper commissioning, quality control, walk in cooler fabrication\n\n\nDuctwork\nDesign, verification of SMACNA compliance, redesign, Manual D calculations.

    "text": "Non Trade Related Skills\nAudio Production using Reaper, Cubase, Native Instruments, Amplitube, and many other audio software solutions. Former (locally touring) bass player for Adwela and the Uprising (wrote, in conjunction with my cousin most of the bass and later featured by another player on the road less traveled). Avergae bass player, mediocre guitar and keys player, extensive practice is sound design and audio mixing. Helped in a local recording studio for a couple years recording other local bands.\nBass and guitar modifications. Rebuilt many guitars doing basic setup work and extensive electronic work. My most extensive project being a complete overhaul of of a Bass VI. Have created many very complicated switching systems which greatly assisted in my understanding of manipulating controls in HVAC and other trades.\nSome electronics hobby experience in modifying and building guitar pedals and many failed attempts at building other devices. I have had less success in this area but have learned a lot concerning the inner workings of control/circuit boards, transistors, diodes, thermistors, resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits, etc.\nLimited but growing experience with HTML, vanilla javascript, CSS, LaTeX, Linux, Quarto, VS Code, markdown, OBS Studio, Davinci Resolve, etc. Built my first websites as a teenager but did not pick up the hobby again until recently. Early coding experience helped in picking the hobby back up.\nHave studied woodworking, machining, welding, and other fundamentals….\nThat’s most of the important stuff….",
